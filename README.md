**Important note: I update this project infrequently. Anyone who wishes to contribute more frequently is welcome.**

A collective resource of settings modifications (*mostly opt-outs*) that attempt to make Windows 10 as private and as secure as possible.

### Running

Download [all.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aghorler/Windows-10-Hardening/master/all.bat), make any required modifications, and run the script as administrator.

Reboot.

### Issues

1. Group policy registry references often change after major updates. This requires updates to these scripts.

2. Many of these modifications are mere *opt-outs*, and are not means to ensure Microsoft are unable to collect telemetry data.
